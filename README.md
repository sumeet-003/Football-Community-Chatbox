⚽ Football Community Chatbox

A real-time, anonymous chat platform built for football fans. This application ensures a clean and safe environment through automatic vulgarism detection and 48-hour message expiry. Built with Streamlit, FastAPI, and MongoDB, it provides fast performance, anonymity, and modern design.

🚀 Features
✅ Vulgarism Detection

All incoming messages are automatically scanned and filtered for offensive or abusive language to ensure a respectful chat environment.

⏲️ Auto Message Expiration (48 Hours)

Messages automatically delete after 48 hours, keeping the chat fresh, relevant, and lightweight.

🕵️ Anonymous User System

No personal data or identity tracking. Users log in using a generated Unique User ID + Password, not linked to any real-world identity.
